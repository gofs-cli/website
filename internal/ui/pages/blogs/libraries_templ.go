This flexibility allows for more creativity which leads to better code  and happier developers.</p><p class=\"para\">In contrast, frameworks, while streamlining development and providing conventions,  restricts a developers ability to create and be expressive. The guardrails built into  frameworks can prevent developers from writing code they way they want. Trying to do  something in a framework that it doesn't cater for, can lead a developer to spend days  searching the corners of the Internet for people who have tried to it and failed,  and then spending days decompiling framework code to figure out how things are wired  in order to get a simple deliverable done the way they want.</p><h2 class=\"text-2xl font-extrabold\">Skilful developers prefer libraries</h2><p class=\"para\">It is not uncommon to struggle to find talented young software engineers who are  prepared to work in these frameworks for example .Net and Java Spring. Some organisations  are trapped in these ecosystems and will keep going with an ever ageing talent pool,  while others switch away from these frameworks and benefit from highly skilled  developers that prefer to work with libraries.</p><p class=\"para\">We are unashamedly developer centered. We love working in well crafted codebases written  by skillful developers who take pride in their craft and their code - these codebases are  easy to extend and debug. Conversely we have experienced the drag of working in poorly  written codebases created by commodity developers. Commodity developers may be cheaper  per day, but they take many times longer to write anything so their overall cost is higher,  but also the code they write is a drag on all future developers who need to work on that  codebase. Cheap commodity developers are a false economy.</p></div>")
